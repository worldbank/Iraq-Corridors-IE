  # DESCRIPTION: Rasterize a road network. Takes the network and, for each pixel
  # within the raster, assigns the fastest speed. 
  # ARGS:
  #   road_sdf: Spatial dataframe of roads
  #   speed_var: name of variable in spatial dataframe that corresponds to speeds (character)
  #   extent: Spatial object where extent should be derived for creating raster. The function
  #           will create a raster using this bounding box. If NULL, uses extent of road_sdf
  #   walking_speed: Walking speed (speed assigned to areas not roads). 
  #   pixel_var: What the pixel value should represent. 
  #              (a) time_to_cross: gives the time to cross each pixel
  #              (b) speed: speed of pixel
  #   restrict_to_extent: If TRUE, areas outside of extent_df are set to 0 (so 
  #                       can't travel on the area). E.g., if extent is a country,
  #                       can't travel outside of the country
  # NOTE: Assumes both road_sdf and extent (1) have the same CRS and (2) are projected
  #       (so map units are meters)

  road_sdf <- road_sdf[!(road_sdf$speed_var_temp %in% 0),]
  
  ## Sort by Speed
  # If multiple polylines interesect with a cell, velox uses the last polygon from
  # the spatial polygons dataframe. Consequently, we sort by speeds from slowest to
  # fastest so that velox uses the fastest speed.
  road_sdf <- road_sdf[order(road_sdf$speed_var_temp),]
