# DataWork

The DataWork folder is organized by dataset, where both github and dropbox contain the same high-level data folder.

Currently, the main analysis datasets are:

* __VIIRS:__ Grid-level analysis with VIIRS.

* __CSO Subdistricts:__ Subdistrict analysis, including market access. Here, variables are aggregated to the subdistrict level. The subdistrict shapefile is from the Iraq Central Statistical Office.
